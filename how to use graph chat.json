Here’s how:\n\n---\n\n## CAPEX Analysis\n\n**CAPEX** refers to the upfront costs of acquiring, installing, and commissioning the MEP systems.\n\n### How to Use the Graph:\n- **Component Inventory:** Each node represents a component (e.g., transformer, panelboard) with type and attributes (e.g., voltage, current rating, AIC rating). You can sum up the quantities and specifications to generate a Bill of Materials (BOM).\n- **Sizing & Specification:** Use attributes like voltage, current, and phase to select appropriate equipment models and sizes, which directly affect cost.\n- **Connection Complexity:** The number and type of edges (connections) indicate wiring/conduit runs, which impact installation labor and material costs.\n- **Spatial Data:** x, y, z coordinates help estimate cable/conduit lengths and installation complexity.\n- **Hierarchy & Redundancy:** The structure reveals system redundancy, distribution hierarchy, and specialty equipment, all of which influence CAPEX.\n\n### Example Workflow:\n1. **Extract all nodes and their attributes** to list required equipment.\n2. **Estimate quantities and sizes** for each component.\n3. **Calculate cable/conduit lengths** using node coordinates and edge connections.\n4. **Apply unit costs** (from cost databases or vendor quotes) to each item.\n5. **Sum up for total CAPEX.**\n\n---\n\n## OPEX Analysis\n\n**OPEX** refers to ongoing operational costs, including energy consumption, maintenance, and repairs.\n\n### How to Use the Graph:\n- **Energy Consumption:** Use edge attributes (voltage, current, phase, frequency, load classification) to estimate power flows and energy usage for each branch.\n- **Maintenance Planning:** Node types and attributes (e.g., AIC rating, equipment type) help identify components with higher maintenance needs or shorter lifespans.\n- **Failure Impact Analysis:** The graph structure shows dependencies—failure of upstream nodes (e.g., transformer) impacts all downstream loads.\n- **Load Classification:** Edge attribute `load_classification` helps break down OPEX by usage type (lighting, HVAC, etc.).\n- **Aging & Replacement:** Use metadata (e.g., installation date, not shown but can be added) to schedule preventive maintenance or replacements.\n\n### Example Workflow:\n1. **Calculate expected current/power** on each edge using node and edge attributes.\n2. **Estimate annual energy use** per load classification and apply local utility rates.\n3. **Identify critical components** for preventive maintenance based on type and rating.\n4. **Model failure scenarios** by removing nodes/edges and analyzing downstream impact.\n5. **Sum up energy, maintenance, and replacement costs for total OPEX.**\n\n---\n\n## Automation\n\n- **Automated Scripts:** Use Python (with NetworkX and Pandas) to parse the GraphML, perform calculations, and generate CAPEX/OPEX reports.\n- **Visualization:** Use Panel to create dashboards showing cost breakdowns, energy flows, and maintenance schedules.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy encoding all relevant physical and operational data in the graph, you can automate and visualize both CAPEX and OPEX analyses, supporting better decision-making for building owners and facility managers.",

Here’s how you can approach this:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Add Maintenance-Relevant Attributes**\nEnhance your GraphML nodes with attributes like:\n- `installation_date` or `last_maintenance_date`\n- `expected_lifetime` (years)\n- `maintenance_interval` (months/years)\n- `usage_level` (optional, e.g., hours per week)\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Load and Parse the Graph**\nUse NetworkX to load the GraphML and access node attributes.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\nG = nx.read_graphml(\"your_system.graphml\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Predict Maintenance Due Dates**\nFor each node, calculate when the next maintenance is due:\n\n```python\ndef maintenance_due(node_data, reference_date):\n    last = datetime.strptime(node_data['last_maintenance_date'], \"%Y-%m-%d\")\n    interval = int(node_data['maintenance_interval'])  # in months\n    next_due = last + timedelta(days=interval*30)\n    return next_due <= reference_date\n\nreference_date = datetime.now()\ndue_nodes = [n for n, d in G.nodes(data=True) if maintenance_due(d, reference_date)]\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Prioritize Using Graph Algorithms**\n- **Centrality:** Use betweenness or degree centrality to prioritize critical nodes.\n- **Subgraph Extraction:** Filter nodes by type or area for targeted maintenance.\n- **Impact Simulation:** Remove a node and see which downstream nodes are affected (using connected components or descendants in a directed graph).\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Generate Maintenance Task List**\nCreate a report of all nodes/components due for maintenance in the given timeframe, sorted by criticality or area.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **(Optional) Predictive Maintenance**\nIf you have usage or sensor data, use statistical models or machine learning to predict failures and schedule maintenance proactively.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Step                | Technique/Algorithm                | Purpose                                 |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Attribute Filtering | Node attribute queries             | Find components due for maintenance     |\n| Centrality          | Betweenness/degree centrality      | Prioritize critical components          |\n| Subgraph Extraction | Induced subgraphs                  | Area/system-specific maintenance lists  |\n| Impact Analysis     | Node removal, descendants, paths   | Assess risk of deferred maintenance     |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nBy enriching your GraphML with maintenance data and using graph algorithms (filtering, centrality, impact analysis), you can automatically predict and prioritize maintenance tasks for any given timeframe.
