Maintenance Task List Helper

This module will provide functions to generate, import, and prioritize maintenance tasks for MEP equipment based on the generated graph.

The goal is to:
- Import a maintenance task list from a CSV file
- Define the structure and columns of the maintenance task list
- Provide placeholder functions for prioritizing and managing tasks

# =============================
# GENERIC TASK TEMPLATE STRUCTURE
# =============================
#
# This table defines the structure for generic maintenance task templates,
# which are not tied to specific equipment instances, but to equipment types.
#
# Column Name                | Type     | Units      | Example Value         | Description
# -------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------
# task_id                    | str      | -          | T001                  | Unique identifier for the maintenance task template
# equipment_type             | str      | -          | transformer           | Type of equipment this task applies to
# task_type                  | str      | -          | inspection            | Type of maintenance (e.g., inspection, replacement)
# recommended_frequency_months| int     | months     | 12                    | Suggested interval between tasks
# description                | str      | -          | "Visual inspection of windings" | Description of the maintenance task
# default_priority           | int      | -          | 1                     | Default priority level for this task type (1=high)
# time_cost                  | float    | hours      | 2.5                   | Estimated time required to complete the task
# money_cost                 | float    | USD        | 500.0                 | Estimated cost to complete the task
# notes                      | str      | -          | "Check for oil leaks" | Free text notes or instructions

# =============================
# DETAILED TASK LIST STRUCTURE (Generated from Graph)
# =============================
#
# This table defines the structure for the detailed maintenance task list,
# which is generated for specific equipment instances in the graph using the generic templates.
#
# Column Name                | Type     | Units      | Example Value         | Description
# -------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------
# task_instance_id           | str      | -          | T001-EL1              | Unique identifier for this specific maintenance task
# equipment_id               | str      | -          | EL1                   | Unique identifier for the equipment instance (from graph)
# equipment_type             | str      | -          | transformer           | Type of equipment (copied from template)
# task_type                  | str      | -          | inspection            | Type of maintenance (copied from template)
# scheduled_date             | str/date | YYYY-MM-DD | 2025-08-01            | Date the task is scheduled
# last_maintenance_date      | str/date | YYYY-MM-DD | 2024-08-01            | Last time this equipment was maintained
# priority                   | int      | -          | 1                     | Calculated or copied from template
# time_cost                  | float    | hours      | 2.5                   | Estimated time required (from template)
# money_cost                 | float    | USD        | 500.0                 | Estimated cost (from template)
# status                     | str      | -          | pending               | Current status (pending, in_progress, complete, etc.)
# notes                      | str      | -          | "Check for oil leaks" | Free text notes or instructions
